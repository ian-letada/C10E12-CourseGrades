# C10E12-CourseGrades
Create a CourseGrades application that simulates a grade book for a class with 12 students that each have  5 test scores. The CourseGrades application should use a GradeBook class that has member variables  grades, which is a two-dimensional array or integers, and methods getGrades() for prompting the user  for the test grades for each student, showGrades() that displays the grades for the class, studentAvg()  that has a student number parameter and then returns the average grade for that student, and testAvg()  that has a test number parameter and then returns the average grade for that test.
